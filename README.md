 Vehicle Control system C project 
This Project is a simple vehicle dynamic control systems that displays 2 menus, the first menu gives 3 choices to the user either to turn on the engine or turn off the engine or quit the system, if the user choose to turn on the engine a second menu appears that will allow the user to choose either to set the traffic light color or set room temperature or engine temperature depending on inputs from console (assuming it is the sensor read value because it is a software only project), so it will change the AC condition, the vehicle speed and the engine temperature controller state.
